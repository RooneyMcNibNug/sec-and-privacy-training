					<h3>..all of us.</h3>
					<small><code>
					<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=761918152">SNOWDEN:</a> Yes, he's on his laptop. And we're looking at the man behind the device. And in his lap is a little boy, a toddler, who's just playing on the keyboard. And the father's smiling. And the little boy looks at the webcam. It's just a glimpse, but to me it seems as though he's looking at me. And it reminds me of my childhood, of learning about technology with my own father. And I realize this man has done nothing wrong. He's just trying to get a job. He's just trying to study. He's just trying to get through life like all of us are. And yet, he's caught up. His children are caught up. We are all caught up by a system that we were not allowed to know existed.

						The trouble is, targeted surveillance frequently includes the indiscriminate collection of the private data of people targeted by race but not involved in any crime. For <a href="https://progressive.org/magazine/black-america-s-state-surveillance-cyril/">targeted communities</a>, there is little to no expectation of privacy from government or corporate surveillance. Instead, we are watched, either as criminals or as consumers. We do not expect policies to protect us. Instead, we’ve birthed a complex and coded culture—from jazz to spoken dialects—in order to navigate a world in which spying, from AT&T and Walmart to public benefits programs and beat cops on the block, is as much a part of our built environment as the streets covered in our blood.

					<p>Even if you "aren't doing anything wrong", surveillance alters people's state of mind.</p>
					<p>Similar to the state you enter when there's a police cruiser behind you.</p>

				  <p>So why would I want to practive digital privacy and anonymity anyways?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Some cases:</h3>
					  <ul>
							<li>Delicate research</li>
							<li>Dodging intrusive tracking</li>
							<li>Communications</li>
							<li>Submitting info anonymously</li>
						</ul>

				  <p>Before exploring tools, we need to talk about OPSEC.</p>
					<code><small>
					  <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/operational-security-and-the-real-world-3c07e7eeb2e8">In every instance, it is the lack of compartmentation between accounts and personas that has been the cause of the pain. Without proper compartmentation, attackers are able to leverage information from one compromised account to access another related account. ..At a bare minimum — keep your business and personal life (and accounts) separate.</a>
					</code></small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>OPSEC in five steps:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Identification of Critical information</li>
							<li>Analysis of Threats</li>
							<li>Analysis of Vulnerabilities</li>
							<li>Assessment of Risk</li>
							<li>Application of proper measures</li>
						</ol>

					<h3>The Tor Browser</h3>
					<img src=img/tor-logo.png>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>An anonymized browser based on Firefox</li>
							<li>Works with Windows, MacOS, and Linux distros</li>
							<li>Tunnels all web traffic through the Tor Network</li>
							<li>Access to anonymous "Onion sites"</li>
							<li>Removes all cookies and web data after closing</li>
							<li>"..private access to an uncensored web."</li>
						</ul>
