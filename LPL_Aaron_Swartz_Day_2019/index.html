					<h3>..all of us.</h3>
					<small><code>
					<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=761918152">SNOWDEN:</a> Yes, he's on his laptop. And we're looking at the man behind the device. And in his lap is a little boy, a toddler, who's just playing on the keyboard. And the father's smiling. And the little boy looks at the webcam. It's just a glimpse, but to me it seems as though he's looking at me. And it reminds me of my childhood, of learning about technology with my own father. And I realize this man has done nothing wrong. He's just trying to get a job. He's just trying to study. He's just trying to get through life like all of us are. And yet, he's caught up. His children are caught up. We are all caught up by a system that we were not allowed to know existed.

						The trouble is, targeted surveillance frequently includes the indiscriminate collection of the private data of people targeted by race but not involved in any crime. For <a href="https://progressive.org/magazine/black-america-s-state-surveillance-cyril/">targeted communities</a>, there is little to no expectation of privacy from government or corporate surveillance. Instead, we are watched, either as criminals or as consumers. We do not expect policies to protect us. Instead, we’ve birthed a complex and coded culture—from jazz to spoken dialects—in order to navigate a world in which spying, from AT&T and Walmart to public benefits programs and beat cops on the block, is as much a part of our built environment as the streets covered in our blood.

					<p>What's "wrong" is not objective, and surveillance builds haystacks to find needles.</p>
					<p>Even if you "aren't doing anything wrong", surveillance alters people's state of mind.</p>
					<p>Similar to the state you enter when there's a police cruiser behind you.</p>

				  <p>So why would I want to practive digital privacy and anonymity anyways?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Reasons people have used digital anonymity tools:</h3>
					  <ul>
							<li>Delicate research</li>
							<li>Dodging intrusive tracking</li>
							<li>Communications</li>
							<li>Submitting info anonymously</li>
							<li>Peace of mind</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
				  <p>Before exploring tools, we need to talk about OPSEC.</p>
					<code><small>
					  <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/operational-security-and-the-real-world-3c07e7eeb2e8">In every instance, it is the lack of compartmentation between accounts and personas that has been the cause of the pain. Without proper compartmentation, attackers are able to leverage information from one compromised account to access another related account. ..At a bare minimum — keep your business and personal life (and accounts) separate.</a>
					</code></small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>OPSEC in five steps:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Identification of Critical information</li>
							<li>Analysis of Threats</li>
							<li>Analysis of Vulnerabilities</li>
							<li>Assessment of Risk</li>
							<li>Application of proper measures</li>
						</ol>

					<h4>Things to be careful doing with anonymizing software:</h4>
					<ul>
							<li>Banking</li>
							<li>Use of personal/work accounts (email, slack, etc)</li>
							<li>Registering to services with similar usernames as your other accounts</li>
							<li>Stray away from posting personal details on public forums</li>
							<li>Giving up a heap information on a small network while being the only one using tor on said network</li>
					</ul>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p>While sometimes it might be best to absolve from doing these things at all while using anonymity tools, there are ways to do them safely through a bit of "compartmentalization"</p>
					</ul>
							<li>Using different circuits and/or sessions</li>
							<li>Always ensuring authentication and sessions for these are done through HTTPS sites (encryption!)</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The Tor Browser</h3>
					<img src=img/tor-logo.png>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>An anonymized browser based on Firefox</li>
							<li>Works with Windows, MacOS, and Linux distros</li>
							<li>Tunnels all the browser traffic through the Tor Network</li>
							<li>Access to anonymous "Onion sites"</li>
							<li>Removes all cookies and web data after closing</li>
							<li>"..private access to an uncensored web."</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>TAILS</h3>

				<section>
					<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A bootable OS where _all_ network traffic is routed through the Tor Network</li>
							<li>Fits on a USB over 8GB</li>
							<li>Stocked with several helpful privacy and security applications/tools</li>
							<li>Leave's no trace of system logs/files on the computer you boot from</li>
							<li>Wipes metadata and logs from the bootable USB</li>

					<small>TAILS includes a great "purging"  application called <a href="https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/doc/mat/"> MAT (Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit)</a></small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>What is metadata?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<code><small>
						<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/metadata"> EFF:</a> Metadata (or "data about data") is data that describes a piece of information, apart from the information itself. So the content of a message is not metadata, but who sent it, when, where from, and to whom, are all examples of metadata. Legal systems often protect content more than metadata: for instance, in the United States, law enforcement needs a warrant to listen to a person's telephone calls, but claims the right to obtain the list of who you have called far more easily. However, metadata can often reveal a great deal, and will often need to be protected as carefully as the data it describes.

					<img src=img/tails_mattwo.png height="300" width="400">
					<img src=img/tails_matthree.png height="300" width="400">
					<small>You can use MAT in terminal - works great against image metadata, but won't clean up things like watermarks, .xls files, etc.</small>

					<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Physical access means "game over".</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Leaving no traces might seem over-paranoid, but in may cases its worth going to these measures.</p>
